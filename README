Lamantanimation is, for now, an animation featuring some manatees in their
habitat, the sea. It is intended to be funny and be implemented in canvas,
served by a node.js server.

As you can see, the project is in a very early state - collaboration will be
difficult for a while yet, as the basic framework is nonexistent. I hope to
soon have in place something that is actually workable. For now, I'd like any
willing contributors to focus on producing assets that can be used further on.

I will elaborate on the work ahead in the issuetracker.
