# Lamantanimation

Lamantanimation is, for now, a chatroom featuring some manatees in their
habitat, the sea. It is intended to be funny and be implemented in canvas,
served by a node.js server.

## Requirements

- node.js
- npm
- socket.io
- coffee-script
- less
- for deployment: ruby, rubygems and capistrano

## State

As you can see, the project is in a very early state - collaboration will be
difficult for a while yet, as the basic framework is nonexistent. I hope to
soon have in place something that is actually workable. For now, I'd like any
willing contributors to focus on producing assets that can be used further on.
